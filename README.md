# eqassoc

Resolution-aware earthquakeâ€“well association (stage vs present) that can refresh in full or update incrementally while remaining CRS-safe.

## Installation

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Command-line usage

The project exposes a console script `eq-assoc`. Common invocations include:

### Full database refresh

Rebuild all associations from scratch, truncating existing result tables.

```bash
eq-assoc --mode full --assoc_mode detailed
```

### Incremental update

Process only earthquakes that have not been associated yet and append the results.

```bash
eq-assoc --mode incremental --assoc_mode detailed
```

### Verbose run targeting specific quake and well

Output debug logs and force re-association for a single quake and well.

```bash
eq-assoc --mode incremental --assoc_mode detailed --verbose \
  --reassociate_quake 12345 --reassociate_wa 67890
```

### Batch size and in-memory mode

Earthquakes are streamed from the database in batches (default 10k) so full re-runs do not exhaust memory. Adjust the size and keep results in memory before writing:

```bash
eq-assoc --mode incremental --batch_size 5000 --in_memory
```

### Controlling activity types and time windows

By default the association considers hydraulic fracturing (HF), water disposal
(WD) and production (PROD) activities.  Use `--types` to specify a subset of
these, e.g. to omit production wells:

```bash
eq-assoc --mode incremental --types HF WD
```

Time-window parameters for each activity type can also be overridden from the
CLI. For example, to shorten the HF association tail:

```bash
eq-assoc --hf_tmax_days 365
```

## Probability determination

The association workflow converts raw distance and time relationships into
standardized probabilities for each injection type.

1. For every earthquake, candidate links to hydraulic fracturing (HF), water
   disposal (WD) and production (PROD) activities are scored using
   distance and time kernels weighted by activity-specific factors.
2. Scores for all linked stages are normalized so their sum equals one,
   producing a per-stage probability `P_stage` that can be compared across
   injection types.
3. Stage probabilities are summed by well to derive `P_well` and by pad to
   derive `P_pad`; each set is re-normalized per earthquake to maintain a
   standard scale.
4. The highest probability stage, well and pad for each earthquake are
   identified along with distance, time offset and well counts.
5. Per-link probabilities are stored in the `eq_well_association` table and
   the aggregated classification in `eq_well_association_classified`.

## Environment

The CLI reads the database connection string from the `EQ_DB_URI` environment variable; the default is `mysql+pymysql://root@localhost/earthquakes`.

Data files are expected under `/home/pgcseiscomp/Documents/bcer_data` unless configured otherwise.
